# Chapter&nbsp;23.&nbsp;Motorisation and Customisation
<p>
    MagicQ Stadium Series products with motorised faders enable many different functions to be applied to the faders with MagicQ changing
    the fader levels when the functions are changed.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the existing playback pages (sets of faders for different songs) the Stadium Series introduces the concept of playback
    banks to enable access to more playbacks on a page.
</p>
<div class="section">
    ## 23.1.&nbsp;Stadium Playback banking
    <p>
        The Stadium playback section is split into two with fader and encoder playbacks. The fader playback section consists of motorised
        fader, FLASH, GO, PAUSE and S buttons. The execute playback section consists of encoders with inbuilt button and FLASH buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the MQ500M/MQ250M and Stadium Connect the playback section is banked to provide access to up to six different playback banks –
        the first bank is PB1 to PB30, the second bank is PB31 to PB60, the third is PB61 to PB90, and so on enabling fast access to 180
        playbacks in total. Typically the first bank would be used for the main song playbacks, whilst the second and third could be used
        for specials or key lighting.
    </p>
    <p>The original MQ500 does not have motorisation so in order to access more playbacks it is neccesary to add a Stadium Wing.</p>
    <p>
        When used in multi console mode, the motorised Stadium consoles can access the same or different banks – enabling two or more
        operators to playback the show with different playbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        When pages are changed the banks will either all change or will change only individual banks depending on the bank ties set up. Page
        holdover and two page holdover works the same as on the MQ500.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Stadium playback banking is designed to avoid the need to change page during songs - pages are used for new songs, rather than
        for additional playbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Playbacks are released the faders by default remain at the level they were set at. It is possible to make faders return to 0%
        when released. In Setup, View Settings, Playback set the "Motor Faders release to zero" option to yes. Any Cue Stacks that have
        "Fader releases stack" set to "yes" will be automatically returned to 0% when released.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 23.2.&nbsp;Fader modes
    <p>
        The current function of the faders is determined by the fader mode which can be selected by pressing and holding down the NEXT PAGE
        or PREV PAGE buttons. This shows a dual height shortcut toolbar with the top row showing the different modes and the bottom row
        showing the bank or offset within that mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        On PC where hold functions are not available, as with other toolbars, it can be locked open by pressing SHIFT and NEXT PAGE or PREV
        PAGE.
    </p>
    <p>The fader modes are:</p>

            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>The non playback modes can be split into programmer modes, master modes, cue modes and preset modes.</p>
    <p>In all modes the fader legends the GO button show red to indicate when the fader is active. Pressing PAUSE deactivates the fader.</p>
    <p>Pressing NEXT PAGE or PREV page pages up and down through pages of the faders.</p>
    <p>
        Pressing CTRL and NEXT PAGE or PREV PAGE enables paging throught the faders in the mode one by one instead of page by page. This
        enables choosing the exact starting point for the first fader.
    </p>
    <p>
        The starting point can be directly set by entering a number on the keyboard, opening the fader shortcut bar (hold PAGE UP or PAGE
        DOWN) and pressing the Head No N / Group No N / Chan No N button.
    </p>
    <p>In all modes pressing SHIFT + BIG PAUSE deactivates all the faders for the mode across all pages.</p>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.1.&nbsp;Programmer modes
        <p>
            In the Programmer modes all changes affect the programmer just as if the heads had been selected from the keypad, encoders or
            palette windows. Pressing CLEAR resets all faders.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Intensity mode the faders are used to control intensity of any of the patched heads starting from the lowest head number.
            Adjusting the fader sets the intensity for that head in the programmer. Pressing the GO button sets the intensity to 100% while
            pressing the PAUSE button removes the intensity for that head from the programmer. The PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN buttons are used to
            page through all the patched heads.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selected Intensity mode operates like Intensity mode, but uses only the selected heads – in order of selection, enabling quick
            access to the intensities of selected heads by simple selecting those heads.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Group mode the faders are used to control intensity of each group of heads starting from Group 1, one group per fader.
            Adjusting the fader sets the intensity for all the heads in that group in the programmer. Pressing the GO button sets all heads
            in the group to 100% whilst pressing the PAUSE button removes the intensity for all heads in that group from the programmer. The
            PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN buttons are used to page through all groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Chans mode the faders are used to control the channels on the console starting from the first universe. Adjusting the fader
            sets the value of the channel in the programmer. Pressing the GO button sets the channel to 255. Pressing the PAUSE button
            removes the value for the channel from the programmer. The PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN buttons are used to page through all channels.
        </p>
        <p>In all these modes pressing the FLASH button puts the level to 100% and then on release returns it to the level of the fader.</p>
        <p>
            Selected Chans mode operates like Chans mode, but uses only the channels of the selected heads – in order of selection, enabling
            quick access to the channels of selected heads by simple selecting those heads.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.2.&nbsp;Master modes
        <p>
            In Intensity Master mode the faders are used to control the master intensity of any of the patched heads starting from the
            lowest head number. Adjusting the fader sets the master intensity for that head. The master intensity operates at the output
            stage modifying the level of the intensity coming from playbacks or the programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pressing the PAUSE button return the intensity master for that head to 100%. The fader is set to half way for 100% - therefore
            it is possible to increase the intensity up to 200% in situations where the playback/programmer intensity is less than 100%. The
            PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN buttons are used to page through all the patched heads. Master Intensities can also be controlled from the
            Intensity Window, View Masters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selected Intensity Master mode operates like Intensity Master mode, but uses only the selected heads – in order of selection,
            enabling quick access to the master intensities of selected heads by simple selecting those heads.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Group Master mode the faders are used to control the master intensity of the group of heads starting from Group 1. Adjusting
            the fader sets the master intensity for all the heads in the group. The master intensity operates at the output stage modifying
            the level of the intensity coming from playbacks or the programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pressing the PAUSE button return the intensity master for all the heads in the group to 100%. The fader is set to half way for
            100% - therefore it is possible to increase the intensity up to 200% in situations where the playback/programmer intensity is
            less than 100%. The PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN buttons are used to page through all groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Master modes pressing the FLASH button puts the master level to 100% and then on release returns it to the level of the
            fader.
        </p>
        <p>
            If both a Master Intensity for a head and one or more Group Masters for the same head are active then they multiply together -
            e.g. if the programmed value is 100%, but then the head intensity master is 50% and a Group intensity master containing that
            head is at 50% then the output will be 25%. This enables multiple levels of masters, just as with existing intensity master
            system - the difference is that now it is not neccesary to explicitly program intensity masters - access is available to
            intensity masters and group masters as soon as the heads are patched.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Speed Master mode the faders and buttons control the global
            <a class="link" href="busking.html#busking-speed-masters" title="19.12.5.&nbsp;Speed Masters">Speed Masters</a>
            .
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.3.&nbsp;Cue modes
        <p>
            These modes operate in a similar way to the Intensities mode and the Sel Intensities mode - you can page through the different
            heads - but they operate on the Cue data rather than programmer data.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Cue mode the intensities of the heads in the current Cue (from the current playback, or selected from the Cue Window) are
            placed on the motorised faders. Moving the faders immediately edits those intensities within the Cue.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Selected Heads Cue mode the currently selected heads are shown. Any that are used in the currently selected Cue are shown
            active. Heads that are not in the currently selected Cue are non active. Moving a fader of a non active Head automatically adds
            that Head into the Cue at the level of the fader.
        </p>
        <p>Pressing the GO button adds the intensity of that Head to the Cue at its current output level.</p>
        <p>Pressing the Pause button in either mode removes the intensity for that Head from the Cue.</p>
        <p>
            As with all changes to MagicQ show data, UNDO can be used to restore the Cue to its previous channel values if channels are
            accidentally added/changed/removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a shortcut to enter the Cue Fader mode - press and hold CUE and press the S button of the Playback. This makes that
            Playback the currently selected and also opens the CUE window showing the data.
        </p>
        <p>Pressing PAUSE in the manual crossfade section returns to the normal Playback Fader mode, enabling quick return to playback.</p>
        <p>
            The Cue Fader mode can also be entered/exited via the new UNFOLD CUE soft button in the Cue Window. The PREV CUE and NEXT CUE
            can be used to bump through Cues in a Cue Stack.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.4.&nbsp;Preset modes
        <p>
            In Preset mode the faders are used to control preset intensities - as per the View Preset in the Intensity window. Preset
            intensities operate independently of the programmer and are used for setting fixed values - for example during changeovers or
            for background lighting.
        </p>
        <p>Pressing GO puts the preset intensity to 100% - pressing PAUSE sets it to 0% (not active).</p>
        <p>Presing FLASH puts the intensity to 100% and then on release returns it to the fader level.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.5.&nbsp;Shortcuts to fader mode
        <p>The fader mode and bank can be selected from a pop up menu by pressing and holding the PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN buttons.</p>
        <p>
            The current fader mode and bank can be recorded as items in the Execute window which can then be operated from the 4x3 Execute
            section enabling single button changing of fader mode or banks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Press and hold NEXT PAGE or PREV PAGE and press RECORD. MagicQ will prompt "Record shortcut - plase press item". Select an item
            in the Execute Window or on the 4x3 Execute buttons (when in Execute Mode).
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively in the Execute Window, select ASSIGN SPECIAL and choose Fader FN. The current fader bank mode and start item will
            be assigned to an item.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Playback mode, ALT and the NEXT PAGE and PREV PAGE buttons can be used to change playback bank as an alternative to holding
            NEXT PAGE / PREV PAGE and selecting the Bank from the toolbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also inbuilt macros for NEXT BANK and PREV BANK which can be assigned to Execute grids for use in Execute windows or
            the 4x3 Execute section.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.6.&nbsp;Fader Touch
        <p>
            MagicQ can tell when users touch the motorised fader knobs. As an option this can be used to change selected playback or to
            pre-visualise that playback in MagicVis.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.7.&nbsp;Disabling motorisation
        <p>
            Motorised faders have moving parts which can wear out with excessive use. Users should avoid creating macros or tracks that
            cause motors to constantly move.
        </p>
        <p>
            Individual motors can be disabled in Setup, View Settings, Hardware, Faulty Motor Mask and Faulty Wing Motor Mask. These are
            hexadecimal bitmasks - fader 1 is 0001, fader 2 is 0002, fader 3 is 0004.
        </p>
        <p>All motors can be disabled in Setup, View Settings, Hardware, Motorisation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 23.2.8.&nbsp;Illuminated Faders
        <p>
            In Playbacks mode the illuminated faders are used to indicate the function of the fader – blue for normal HTP level control,
            green for LTP faders, red for Intensity Masters and orange for FX Speed and FX size masters.
        </p>
        <p>
            The faders can be configured to use the custom colour tags in the Cue Stack (set Setup, Windows, Playback Col Tag option to Cue
            Stack) thus enabling complete user control.
        </p>
        <p>In Intensity and Selected Intensity mode the illuminated faders are set to white.</p>
        <p>In Group mode the illuminated faders are set to yellow.</p>
        <p>In Master modes (Int Master, Group Master, Sel Int Master) the illuminated faders are set to red.</p>
        <p>In Channels and Selected Channels mode the illuminated faders are set to cyan.</p>
        <p>In Presets mode the illuminated faders are set to green.</p>
        <p>The overall brightness for the faders can be set by holding CTRL and using the encoders/soft buttons.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 23.3.&nbsp;Playback Encoders
    <p>The playback encoders can be used for many different functions including:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem">Intensity (HTP channel control)</li>
            <li class="listitem">LTP channel control</li>
            <li class="listitem">FX Size</li>
            <li class="listitem">FX Speed</li>
            <li class="listitem">FX Speed and FX Size</li>
            <li class="listitem">Rate (not implemented yet)</li>
            <li class="listitem">Time (not implemented yet)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        When Cues are recorded to an Execute Playbacks (e.g. PB16 to PB30) by default the encoders will control the function of the Cue
        Stack on that Playback. The user can choose the Encoder mode to determine which function the encoder has. The current state of the
        encoder is shown in the playback legend.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible to chose to control one or more different Playbacks or even a separate Cue Stack to control in which case the encoder
        is not related to the specific Playback. The following options are available from Cue Stack options, Fader tab, Encoder Mode:
    </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem">This Playback</li>
            <li class="listitem">Other Playback</li>
            <li class="listitem">All Playback on this Bank</li>
            <li class="listitem">All Playback on this Page</li>
            <li class="listitem">Other Cue Stack</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        When Cues are recorded to a Fader Playback, if there is no Cue Stack assigned to the Execute Playback above then the encoder from
        the Execute Playback will automatically take any encoder function that is set on the Fader Playback. This means that it is easy, for
        example, to record a FX Cue onto a fader playback and use the encoder above it to control the speed.
    </p>
    <p>When set to Other Payback the Playback ID is specified in the Control Item option.</p>
    <p>
        When set to Other Cue Stack then the Cue Stack ID is specified in the Control Item option. If the Encoder Mode is LTP or HTP and the
        Cue Stack is assigned to a Playback on the current Playback Page then it will activate from the Playback, otherwise it will activate
        from the Stack Store. As per the usual Cue Stack options in will only activate if Fader Activates is set to yes. For FX Size and FX
        Speed this will only take effect if the Cue Stack is already active on a Playback or within an Execute Grid or the Stack Store.

        ### 23.3.1.&nbsp;Illuminated Playback Encoders
        <p>
            In Playbacks mode the illuminated encoders are used to indicate the function of the encoder – blue for normal HTP level control,
            green for LTP faders, red for Intensity Masters and orange for FX Speed and FX size masters. The encoders can be set to use the
            custom colour tags in the Cue Stack thus enabling complete user control.
        </p>
        <p>In other modes the illumination follows the same colour as the faders.</p>
