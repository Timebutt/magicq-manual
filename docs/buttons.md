    <span class="strong"><strong>Undo</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    The Undo button allows the last few changes in the programmer to be undone. Press SHIFT and Undo to redo a change. The Undo
    functionality is enable in the Setup Window, Settings View.
</p>
<p>
    In versions before v1.8.2.1 MagicQ Undo does not undo patch, record, set, move, copy or any other actions. If a major mistake is made
    then you can restore to a previous version of the show file using the
    <a class="link" href="system-management.html#backup-archives" title="51.15.&nbsp;Backup Archives">Backup Archives</a>
    feature.
</p>
<p>
    From v1.8.2.1 MagicQ undo can now be set so that all actions can be undone except for a small number of file related functions such as
    loading a new show file. In Setup, View Settings, Prog tab set "Undo mode" to "Undo programmer and actions".
</p>
<p>
    Initially when UNDO is pressed any actions in the programmer will be undone - such as changes to head selection, head attributes such as
    Int, Pos, Col, Beam. Pressing UNDO again will undo any programmer changes for a maximum of 4 undo steps. After this Undo will start
    undoing actions including Record, Set, Move, Copy, Remove and Patch operations.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to redo any actions using SHIFT + UNDO. When some changes are undone, then once a new action is performed (e.g. recording
    a new Cue) it is then not possible to Redo any of the actions that were previously undone. The new action, and previous ones that have
    not been undone (or which have been redone) can be undone.
</p>
<p>
    Press CTRL and UNDO to open the Undo History window. In the Undo history window it is possible to jump backwards and forwards in the
    Undo history.
</p>
<p>The Undo history is reset when loading a new show file, or restarting the console.</p>
<p>
    The toolbar now supports Undo, Redo and Undo History in the Edit Menu. Short cuts CTRL Z and CTRL Y are supported for undo and redo
    respectively.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this function is "beta" and undoing actions could cause problems with the show file - we strongly recommend saving the show
    regularly to different named files and backing up to USB stick.
