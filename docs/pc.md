# Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Using MagicQ on PCs and Macs
<p>
    The MagicQ software for PCs and Macs has exactly the same features as the MagicQ console software with support for previsualisation of
    up to 256 universes, and full output of 64 Universes. Along with support for ChamSys low cost MagicDMX interface, for simple USB-DMX
    output.
</p>
<p>When MagicQ PC or Mac is installed for the first time, it will show awindow with choices of demo shows.</p>

    </span>
</p>
<p>
    This window can be hidden on subsequent starts by pressing the "Hide Options Next Time" button. It can be reactivated by setting the
    Setup, View Settings, Windows, Start Mode option to "Choose Demo show".
</p>
<div class="section">
    ## 3.1.&nbsp;Simple Generic Console
    <p>Choosing Simple Generic Console opens MagicQ in Simple View and loads a Simple 48 Channel Generic Console show file.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject">
            <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/panelsimple48chan.png" alt="image" />
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this mode the console simply operates as a 48 channel traditional theatre console with 48 dimmers patched on Universe 1 at
        channels 1 through 48.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a MagicQ Wing, MagicQ Dual DMX Interface or MagicDMX interface is connected to MagicQ then the 48 channels will be automatically
        output on the 1
        <sup>st</sup>
        output.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are 10 Playback Faders labelled PB1 to PB10. Depending on your screen resolution you may have a S, &gt; and || button for each
        fader. Pressing in the box labelled PB1 to PB10 is the same as pressing the appropriate S button.
    </p>
    <p>To record a Cue set the faders as required. Then press REC and press the S button of the Playback fader you wish to record it to.</p>
    <p>Press CLEAR to clear the Programmer and return the faders to their defaults.</p>
    <p>To record a chase, record multiple Cues to a Playback fader simply record more than one cue to a Playback fader.</p>
    <p>To remove the Cues from a fader press REM and press the S button of the Playback fader you wish to remove Cues from.</p>
    <p>
        To name a fader press SET and press the S button of the Playback fader you wish to name. You will be shown a text entry box. Type
        the name followed by RETURN.
    </p>
    <p>Multiple pages of faders are supported through the Next Page / Previous Page buttons.</p>
    <p>
        It is possible to interchange between the Normal and Simple views of the console by pressing the Norm and Simple buttons in the top
        right corner of the Application.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    ## 3.2.&nbsp;Technician Test Head
    <p>
        The Technician Test Head mode enables technicians to test a moving light or other head in a very simple way. Simply press the TEST
        SHOW soft button and select a head and a mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new show will be created using that head patched at DMX address 1 on the first Universe. The 48 faders show up to 48 channels of
        the head. Each fader is named with the attribute name and the values are set to their default values.
    </p>
    <p>The picture below shows a Clay Paky Alpha Spot HPE 1200 in Standard mode.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="inlinemediaobject">
            <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/panelsimpletestmode.png" alt="image" />
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Playback faders are automatically set up with some useful functions including Macros for Lamp On, Reset and Lamp Off, Locate and
        Movement, Colour, Gobo and Strobe tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a MagicQ Wing, MagicQ Twin DMX Interface or MagicDMX interface is connected to MagicQ then the head will be controlled on the 1
        <sup>st</sup>
        output.
    </p>
    <p>The preset faders can be used to change the values of individual attributes. Use SHIFT and the faders to make a fine adjustment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 3.3.&nbsp;Demo Shows
    <p>The start up Window gives also gives a choice of a standard Lighting demo show or a PixelMapping demo show.</p>
    <p>
        Additional demo shows for other head types, media servers and visualisers can be found by going to Setup, View Settings, Load Show
        and selecting the demo show folder.
    </p>

        </span>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 3.4.&nbsp;Touch View
    <p>
        The Touch View is designed for use with touch screens with buttons that are sized bigger so that it is easier to select functions.
        Select Touch View by pressing Touch or Touch2 in the top right corner of the Application.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 3.5.&nbsp;Playback mode
    <p>
        MagicQ PC supports a Playback Mode which enables MagicQ to be run in a pure "Playback" mode. This mode is selected by clicking on
        the new Playback mode Icon on the desktop or in the Programs, ChamSys MagicQ PC menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        Playback mode is only supported when connected to a MagicQ Wing or MagicQ USB interface. The MagicQ interface must be connected and
        powered on before MagicQ is started in Playback mode. Note Playback mode is not supported with MagicDMX or 3rd Party interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Playback mode MagicQ it is not possible to record or make changes to the show data. MagicQ will not save the show files / status
        files. Changes (e.g. change of chase speed) will be lost when the application is stopped and restarted.
    </p>
    <p>Playback Mode shows a much reduced set of buttons on the screen – only buttons required for show playback are shown.</p>
    <p>
        In Playback Mode only pages of playbacks that have been programmed are shown – pressing NEXT PAGE will automatically change to the
        next programmed page and will cycle around all programmed pages.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 3.6.&nbsp;Copy and paste to external applications via the clipboard
    <p>MagicQ now supports copying and pasting to external applications such as Word, Excel and text editors.</p>
    <p>
        On the toolbar select Edit, Copy or press the short cut key CTRL C. The item at the cursor position in the focused window, or
        multiple items if cursor selection is active, will be copied to the Clipboard. In the external application CTRL V (or Paste) can be
        used to paste the information.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible to quickly select all items in a window on the toolbar by selecting Edit, Select All or using the short cut CTRL A.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also possible to copy and paste into MagicQ from external applications. In the external application use CTRL C or Copy to copy
        the required data to the Clipboard. In MagicQ change to the Window that you wish to paste to, cursor select the required cells and
        on the toolbar select Edit, Paste or press CTRL V. The data will be pasted into the MagicQ window. MagicQ only supports pasting of
        text data - typically names of items. When pasting to multiple selected cells MagicQ verifies that the quantity of data on the
        Clipboard matches the number of selected cells.
    </p>
    <p>Extreme care should be used when pasting into MagicQ.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 3.7.&nbsp;MagicQ PC / Mac Restrictions (Demo mode)
    <p>
        When MagicQ PC (Windows, Linux or Mac) is not connected to a MagicQ USB interface, Connect, MagicQ USB Wing or SnakeSys network
        product, then a small number of remote and automation features are restricted and "Demo Mode" is shown in the title bar. This does
        not affect show programming or playback.
    </p>
    <p>
        The restricted features that require a MagicQ USB interface*, MagicQ Wing or SnakeSys node to be connected are: (Please note that
        MagicDMX Interfaces Basic and Full do not unlock
        <span class="emphasis"><em>demo mode</em></span>
        )

    </div>
    <p>
        *Note that the MagicDMX interface (Basic or Full) do not lift these restrictions, as these are low cost interfaces intended for
        learning how to program the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Support for receiving MIDI notes, Control Change (CC) and Show control (MSC) from 3rd party USB/Virtual MIDI interfaces on PC is
        only enabled when the system has a MagicQ Rack Mount Dongle connected. Other MagicQ Wings and Interfaces such as the Two Universe
        DMX, Mini Wing, Mini Connect, PC Wing and Compact Connect do not enable this functionality. A MagicQ Rack Mount dongle may be used
        in conjunction with a MagicQ Wing or Interface on a PC based system if MIDI notes are required.
    </p>
    <p>
        MagicQ PC/Mac running with the restricted features unlocked, supports control of the first 10 playbacks (PB1 to PB10) via ChamSys
        remote control protocol, MIDI and automations. This enables synchronisation with show control systems. Playbacks 11 to 202 can only
        be controlled by MagicQ Playback/Execute/Extra Wings. On MagicQ consoles all 202 playbacks can be controlled by these protocols.
    </p>
    <p>MagicQ PC/Mac supports 256 universes for Previsualisation and 64 universes for full output.</p>
    <p>
        In the MQ250M, MQ500 and MQ500M Previs panel modes in order to protect our customers investment in full MQ500 and MQ500M consoles,
        the normal outputs are disabled and only visualisation is supported. Visualisation can be internal MagicVis or direct network links
        to external 3rd part visualisers. When universes 65 to 256 are used with external visualisers there will be occasional breaks in the
        DMX to prevent usage to control real lighting rigs. MagicQ warns if universes are enabled when entering the MQ500 and MQ500M Previs
        panels.
    </p>

    ## 3.8.&nbsp;MagicHD Stand Alone Restriction
    <p>MagicHD when run as part of MagicQ supports 8 layers.</p>
    <p>
        MagicHD when run as a stand alone program (not as part of MagicQ) only supports 1 layer unless a MagicQ / MagicHD USB Dongle is
        fitted to the system, or is connected via network to a MagicQ console with encoders, or connected via network to a MagicQ PC/MAC
        system with a connected MagicQ USB Wing with encoders.
    </p>
    <p>SnakeSys products do not unlock stand alone MagicHD.</p>
