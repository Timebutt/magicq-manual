# Chapter 5. MagicQ Layout
<div class="section">
    ## 5.1. Physical layout
    <p>
        All MagicQ consoles are very similar - they differ mainly in the number of playback faders. The programming interface is consistent
        across the entire range of consoles. MagicQ software on PC and Mac mimics the layout of the physical buttons on the MagicQ Consoles
        - a choice of different Panels is available from the Panel Menu. The Full Panel mode mimics Compact consoles whilst the Stadium
        Panel modes mimic the Stadium consoles. It is possible to change between different panel views at any time - it does not affect the
        programmed show - it just determines what buttons, faders and encoders are available for programming and playback.

    </p>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.1. Touch Screen, Encoders &amp; Soft Buttons
        <p>There are 8 rotary encoders placed around the main touch screen.</p>
        <p>
            The buttons around the top and sides of the display referred to as soft buttons since their function changes according to the
            active window on the touch screen. The current function of a soft button is displayed on the touch screen. To select the
            function you can either press the screen or the soft button itself next to the screen, depending on the console model
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/frontpanel.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The function of the rotary encoders changes according to the active window with the current function being displayed adjacent to
            the encoder.
        </p>
        <p>There are ALT, SHIFT and CTRL buttons.</p>
        <p>SHIFT is used for extra MagicQ programming functions.</p>
        <p>CTRL is used for console settings such as setting screen brightness, console lamp brightness.</p>
        <p>
            ALT is used to select alternative functions on MagicQ consoles that do not have a physical button for the particular function -
            the ALT function of a button is normally labelled on the panel.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.2. Main Windows
        <p>
            The area in the centre of the screen is the windows section in which the various control windows are displayed. There are three
            main types of windows – boxes style windows which have large boxes such as the Group Window, spreadsheet style editing windows
            such as the Patch Window, and free form windows such as the Plot, Colour Picker, and Timeline windows.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/grouppatchwindow.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            A window is displayed by pressing the appropriate window button. On MagicQ PC/Mac the window can be selected from the Window
            Menu from the toolbar. Changing window does not affect programming or playback.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple windows can be displayed at one time by sizing and positioning the windows appropriately by clicking on the window
            title bar or using the SIZE button. On MagicQ PC/Mac the size and position can also be selected from the View Menu from the
            toolbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">

            </span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.3. Layouts
        <p>Layouts specify a complete configuration of windows across one or more monitors.</p>
        <p>
            Layouts can be selected using the Layout buttons - to select the Palettes layout (Groups, Positions, Colours and Beams) press
            the Layout 1 button.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Stadium consoles the layout buttons are on the left side of the main touch screen. Use CTRL + the layout buttons to access
            more pages of Layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Compact consoles there are physical Layout 1, Layout 2 and Layout 3 buttons by the keypad. On these consoles SHIFT + Layout 1
            gets Layout 4, SHIFT + Layout 2 gets Layout 5 and SHIFT + Layout 3 gets Layout 6. Press CTRL to access more layout buttons on
            the top soft buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/layouts.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            For more Layouts press ALT + CUE STACK to open the Layout Window. Layouts can be recorded to the Layout Window, named, moved and
            removed. When recording, the monitor mask can be chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the Layout Window is open full size on the first monitor then the Layout Window is not included in the Layout. In all other
            cases the Layout Window is included in the Layout.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.4. Active Window
        <p>
            When a window button is pressed, that window becomes the active window. The active window is on the top of the screen and is
            easily identified as the window with the highlighted title bar at the top. It is also the window with the cursor in it.
        </p>
        <p>An item in a window can be selected either</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                <li class="listitem">By pressing the touch screen over the appropriate part of the window</li>
                <li class="listitem">By moving the cursor to the appropriate position and pressing the ENTER button.</li>
                <li class="listitem">By moving the mouse to the position and pressing the left mouse button.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
            The cursor can be moved around the active window using the cursor keys in the Editor area of the console or via the cursor keys
            on the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            PG UP, PG DN, PG LEFT and PG RIGHT can be used to scroll the window in the appropriate direction. HOME and END can be used to
            get to the start and end of the window respectively.
        </p>
        <p>On Stadium and Compact consoles the PG UP, PG DN, PG LEFT and PG RIGHT use ALT and the cursor keys.</p>
        <p>
            On Stadium consoles HOME and END use ALT and HEAD and TIME respectively. On Compact consoles user ALT and LAYOUT 1 and LAYOUT 3.
        </p>
        <p>On PC/Mac the contents of a Window can be printed to a printer or pdf file by selecting File, Print Window from the toolbar.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.5. Window Sizing
        <p>
            MagicQ supports a Window Size dialogue box to enable the window position and window size to be selected directly with one press
            directly rather than stepping through all the possible window sizes and positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The window size dialog box can also be opened by double clicking on the title bar of the window that you wish to size. On MagicQ
            consoles the window size button SIZE opens the Window Size dialog box (ALT EXEC on Compact consoles, and ALT PATCH on Stadium
            consoles).
        </p>
        <p>
            MagicQ allows sizing of windows to 1,2 or 3 rows when using the LEFT (1..4) and RIGHT (1..4) window sizes. By default they fill
            the left or right side automatically, but you can specify for each window whether they should be restricted to 1,2 or 3 rows.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you only have LEFT (1..4) windows opened then they will automatically spread across the whole width - so you can choose the
            left column, right column or whole width.
        </p>
        <p>The windows sizes are positions are stored/recalled in Layouts and also in the show file.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.6. Support for Find in MagicQ windows
        <p>MagicQ supports a Find function which searches the text fields in the current focused Window.</p>
        <p>
            On the toolbar select Edit, Find or press the short cut key CTRL F. Alternatively on consoles press CTRL and CURSOR RIGHT. Then
            enter the text to search for. The find can also be invoked by entering text on the command line and then using any of the
            previous methods to start the Find operation.
        </p>
        <p>To search again forwards press CTRL and CURSOR RIGHT. To search again backwards press CTRL and CURSOR LEFT.</p>
        <p>
            The CTRL F shortcut only works on PC/Macs when MagicQ Keyboard Mode is set to Normal. In all other MagicQ Keyboard Modes the
            CTRL and keyboard keys open MagicQ windows.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.7. Support for Cut and Paste in MagicQ windows
        <p>
            Cut and paste is supported within MagicQ windows and between different MagicQ windows. It can also be used on PC and Macs to
            copy between MagicQ and other applications, making an easy way to transfer data in and out of MagicQ.
        </p>
        <p>The keyboard shortcuts CTRL C and CTRL V can be used to cut and paste within MagicQ PC.</p>
        <p>On consoles hold CTRL and press COPY for copy. Hold CTRL and press UPDATE to paste.</p>
        <p>Multiple cells can be cut and pasted at a time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.8. Status and Display Windows
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/commandentry.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Towards the bottom of the touch screen are two small windows, the Status Display and the Input Display. The Status Display shows
            the current date and time, the ADD / SWAP status of the console and other relevant status information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The status window also shows warnings - for example if
            <span class="emphasis"><em>INVALID NET</em></span>
            is seen here this indicates MagicQ has been setup to output via Network e.g. Art-Net and that MagicQ’s IP address has been set
            differently to the PC’s network adapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/statusdisplay.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Input Display shows the data that has been currently entered through the keypad and the keyboard. Note that text is not
            entered into the main Windows until ENTER is pressed. This allows the user to choose whether the keyboard data is SET into
            fields in the windows or onto Playbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/inputdisplay.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            After a command has been entered it also confirms that the command has been accepted and shows any error messages when a command
            is not possible.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.9. Head Control
        <p>
            The area around the two large rotary encoders is referred to as the head control area. It is used to alter the parameters of
            individual heads and apply effects such as fans over groups of heads.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/headcontrol.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>The NEXT HEAD and PREV HEAD buttons are used to select an individual head to modify.</p>
        <p>The other buttons control the selection mode; LOCATE, HIGHLIGHT, FAN, SINGLE, ODD/EVEN, and ALL.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.10. Editor Buttons
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/editor.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Editor buttons are used to modify program data. The 8 buttons on the right hand side are the action buttons which are used
            to modify show data. The action buttons are UNDO, REMOVE, MOVE, COPY, SET, INCLUDE, UPDATE, and RECORD.
        </p>
        <p>The buttons on the left:</p>
        <p>BLIND and CLEAR affect the programmer</p>
        <p>REL and SELECT affect playbacks</p>
        <p>SHIFT selects alternate functions</p>
        <p>←- undoes keyboard input and clears actions</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.1.11. Playback
        <p>
            The Playback area is situated directly below the touch screen and consists of 10 playbacks each with a fader and four buttons
            (FLASH, GO, STOP, SELECT). The area above each of the playbacks on the touch screen is used to provide information about the
            status of the playback.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject">
                <img src="https://secure.chamsys.co.uk/help/documentation/magicq/images/playback.png" alt="image" />
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The playback area also contains a Grand Master, a Sub Master, Page Select buttons and a Manual Playback for taking control of
            Cue Stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cross fade section contains a GO, STOP. FWD, BCK buttons, a cross fader and a master GO button. The cross fade section
            controls the current playback selected with the S button.
        </p>
        <p>On the MQ500 there are 15 fader playbacks and 15 execute playbacks above them.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 5.2. Keyboard, Keypad, Select &amp; Confirm Windows
    <p>
        MagicQ has a set of additional on-screen Windows that can be used to enter text, select items and confirm actions. You can choose
        whether you use the physical keyboard/keypad to navigate around these items or whether you use the mouse/touch.
    </p>
    <p>To open the Keyboard Window at any time press SET SET. To open the icon selector press SHIFT + SET.</p>
    <p>
        Confirm Windows are shown when you carry out important actions that may overwrite or delete show data. You can confirm an action by
        pressing 1 on the keypad. To cancel the action press 0 on the keypad.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    ## 5.3. Common Actions
    <p>
        MagicQ utilises many common actions for carrying out programming functions. All the actions use similar button presses. Once you
        understand the action in one Window, you will understand how it is done in another Window.
    </p>
    <p>We strongly recommend you make yourself familiar with these actions – they will save you valuable programming time.</p>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.3.1. Items
        <p>
            Actions in a Window can be carried out on individual items or on multiple items. For actions on a single item, use the cursor
            keys to move around the Window so that the cursor is over the required item.
        </p>
        <p>
            For multiple items in a Window, move the cursor to the first item. Then press and hold the SHIFT button whilst moving the cursor
            to the last item. All the items will be highlighted.
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively hold the CTRL button and select multiple individual items.</p>
        <p>
            In spreadsheet style Windows (e.g. Patch) pressing the touch screen or left clicking on the item with the mouse moves the cursor
            to the item. You can highlight multiple Window items by pressing the touch screen and moving the touch across multiple items.
        </p>
        <p>
            In boxes style Windows (e.g. Group), pressing the touch screen or left clicking performs the function associated with the item
            (e.g. recalls that Group). In these Windows use SHIFT or CTRL and the cursor keys to highlight multiple boxes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.3.2. Setting the value of items
        <p>To set the value of one or more items in a spreadsheet style window:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem">Move the cursor over the item (s)</li>
                <li class="listitem">Enter a value on the keypad and press ENTER.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>OR</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem">Type in the value on the keypad</li>
                <li class="listitem">Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the item.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            For items that have a simple value of yes or no if you do not enter a value on the keypad then the value will toggle. For items
            that have multiple values double click on the field for a list of values. On the touch screen select the field and then press
            anywhere in the Input Display (right side area underneath the main window) to bring up the list of values.
        </p>
        <p>Items that are coloured darker are read only and therefore cannot be set.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.3.3. Naming items
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem">Press the SET button</li>
                <li class="listitem">Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the item to name.</li>
                <li class="listitem">Enter the name on the external or on screen keyboards</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            When working in spreadsheets style windows with an external keyboard it is not necessary to press the SET button in the above
            sequence - you can edit the spreadsheet like any other, just by moving to the appropriate box and entering text on the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            To name multiple items it is often easier to highlight the items before pressing SET. If you press SET immediately after
            highlighting multiple items then the console will assume that these are the items you wish to set.
        </p>
        <p>You can also press SET instead of pressing ENTER in the above sequences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.3.4. Moving items
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem">Press the MOVE button.</li>
                <li class="listitem">Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the source item.</li>
                <li class="listitem">Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the destination item.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You can also press MOVE instead of pressing ENTER in the above sequences.</p>
        <p>
            To move multiple items it is often easier to highlight the items before pressing MOVE. If you press MOVE immediately after
            highlighting multiple items then the console will assume that these are the source items and will only prompt for the
            destination. You can hold SHIFT or CTRL to highlight multiple items.
        </p>
        <p>
            From 1.7.6.4 MagicQ supports dragging to move items within Windows. Press SHIFT + MOVE to enter Drag Move mode. Items can then
            be dragged and dropped within windows. Drag Move mode will continue until MOVE is pressed again, or BACKSPACE is pressed.
        </p>
        <p>The MOVE button flashes when in Drag Move mode.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        ### 5.3.5. Copying items
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">

                <li class="listitem">Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the source item.</li>
                <li class="listitem">Press the touch screen / click / ENTER over the destination item.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You can also press COPY instead of pressing ENTER in the above sequence.</p>
        <p>
            To copy multiple items highlight it is often easier to highlight the items before pressing COPY. If you press COPY immediately
            after highlighting multiple items then the console will assume that these are the source items and will only prompt for the
            destination. You can hold SHIFT or CTRL to highlight multiple items.
        </p>
        <p>
            When copying Cues, Cue Stacks or Pages the console by default does not make individual copies of the Cues - the Cue Stacks link
            to the same Cues. To copy unlinked (i.e. to create new Cues) then press SHIFT and COPY in the above sequence and select
            Unlinked.
